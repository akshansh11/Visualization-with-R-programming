> #The first step to make ggplot is to define a ggplot object which can be done with the function 'ggplot'.
> #To initiate an object we use following command:
> ggplot(data=murders)
> #We can also pipe the data with following code which is equivalent to above code:
> murders %>% ggplot()

> #LAYERS
> #In ggplot we create the graph by adding layers, we add them component by components. 
> #Layers can define geometry, compute summary statistics, finds what scales to use and even change styles. 
> #To add layers we use symbol,'+'. 
> #Syntax: DATA%>%ggplot()+LAYER 1 + LAYER 2+ LAYER 3+......+LAYER N
> #Usually first added layers define the geometry
> #'aes' functions connects the data what we see in the graph.
> #We refer this connection as 'aesthetic mappings'.
